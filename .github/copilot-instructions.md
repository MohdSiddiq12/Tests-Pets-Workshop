# Dog shelter 

This is an application to allow people to look for dogs to adopt. It is built in a monorepo, with a Flask-based backend and Astro-based frontend.

## Backend

- Built using Flask and SQLAlchemy
- Use type hints
- Add a function to validate dog age. The function should ensure age is between 0 and 20 (inclusive). If age is outside this range, raise a ValueError.

## Frontend

- Built using Astro and Svelte
- TypeScript should use arrow functions rather than the function keyword
- Pages should be in dark mode with a modern look and feel
